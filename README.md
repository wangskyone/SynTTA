## 📢 Important Notice: Code Status

Thank you for your interest in our work!

Our paper is currently under peer review. To maintain the integrity of the review process and prepare for the official release, we are providing a **partial release of the core code** at this time.

**This repository currently includes:**
* The core **model architecture** for `SynTTA`, including our proposed `Online Bayesian Prior Correction (OBPC)` and `Gradient-Modulated Batch Normalization (GMBN)` modules.

**This repository does <u>not</u> currently include:**
* Full training and evaluation scripts
* Data loading and preprocessing pipelines
* Pre-trained model weights

We are committed to releasing the full, reproducible codebase, including all necessary scripts and model weights, **as soon as the paper is accepted**.

Thank you for your understanding and patience!
